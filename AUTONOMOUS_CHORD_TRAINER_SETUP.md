# Autonomous Chord Trainer - Setup Guide

## 🎯 What This Does

A **fully autonomous** self-learning chord detection system that:
1. **Generates** chords with all inversions via MIDI
2. **Sends** them to Ableton to play through a synth
3. **Listens** to the audio playback
4. **Analyzes** the audio in real-time
5. **Correlates** analysis with ground truth (it knows what it played!)
6. **Trains** ML model automatically
7. **Saves** trained model for use in MusicHal_9000

## 🛠️ Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create IAC Driver Port

On macOS:
1. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications → Utilities)
2. Window → Show MIDI Studio
3. Double-click "IAC Driver"
4. Check "Device is online"
5. Add a port named: **"IAC Driver Chord Trainer Output"**
6. Click Apply

### Step 2: Configure Ableton Live

1. **Create MIDI track**
2. **Input**: Set to "Chord Trainer Output"
3. **Monitor**: Set to "In"
4. **Load instrument**: Piano, Rhodes, or any synth you like
5. **Make sure track is armed** (red button)

### Step 3: Set Audio Input

You need to capture Ableton's audio output back into the system:

**Option A: Use MacBook Microphone** (simplest)
- Just play through speakers and use built-in mic
- Device 2 (from your test_audio_devices.py)

**Option B: Use BlackHole** (best quality)
1. Install BlackHole: https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole
2. Create aggregate device in Audio MIDI Setup
3. Set Ableton output to BlackHole
4. Set Python input to BlackHole

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Training (14 chord types × 6 inversions = 84 variations)

```bash
# Using MacBook microphone (device 2)
python autonomous_chord_trainer.py --input-device 2

# With custom settings
python autonomous_chord_trainer.py \
    --input-device 2 \
    --chord-duration 2.5 \
    --train-interval 30
```

### Advanced Training (All chromatic chords)

Edit the script's `main()` function to use:
```python
all_chromatic_chords = [
    (root, quality)
    for root in ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']
    for quality in ['', 'm', '7', 'maj7', 'm7']
]
```

This gives you **12 × 5 = 60 chord types × 6 inversions = 360 variations**!

## 📈 Training Strategy

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
```bash
# 7 chords × 2 qualities × 6 inversions = 84 variations
python autonomous_chord_trainer.py --input-device 2 --chord-duration 1.5
```

### Full Training (30 minutes)
```bash
# Edit script to use all chromatic chords
# 12 × 5 × 6 = 360 variations
python autonomous_chord_trainer.py --input-device 2 --chord-duration 2.0
```

### Overnight Training (comprehensive)
```bash
# All 14 chord qualities × 12 roots × 6 inversions = 1,008 variations
python autonomous_chord_trainer.py --input-device 2 --chord-duration 3.0

## 🎓 Using the Trained Model

### In Interactive Chord Trainer:

Replace the model path:
```python
# In test_interactive_chord_trainer.py
self.model_path = 'models/autonomous_chord_model.pkl'
```

### In MusicHal_9000:

Load the autonomous model:
```python
# In MusicHal_9000.py _load_ml_chord_model()
model_path = 'models/autonomous_chord_model.pkl'
scaler_path = 'models/autonomous_chord_scaler.pkl'
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Progress

Watch the terminal output:
- **Samples collected**: Should be 30-60 per chord (depending on duration)
- **Training accuracy**: Should be >90% after first training
- **Unique chords**: Increases with each chord type

### Good Signs:
- ✅ Consistent sample collection (40-60 per chord)
- ✅ Training accuracy >90%
- ✅ Model saves successfully

### Warning Signs:
- ⚠️  Very few samples (<10 per chord) → Check audio input
- ⚠️  Training accuracy <80% → May need more samples
- ⚠️  No MIDI output in Ableton → Check IAC Driver connection

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Port not found"
```
❌ Port 'IAC Driver Chord Trainer Output' not found!
```
**Fix**: Create the IAC Driver port in Audio MIDI Setup

### "No audio samples"
```
🎹 Playing: C (inv=0, oct=0) → [60, 64, 67]
   Collected 0 samples
```
**Fix**: 
1. Check Ableton is playing (track armed, monitor on)
2. Verify audio input device with `test_audio_devices.py`
3. Turn up Ableton volume

### "Audio listener failed to start"
```
❌ Failed to start audio listener: Error -9986
```
**Fix**: Use different audio device:
```bash
python test_audio_devices.py  # Find working device
python autonomous_chord_trainer.py --input-device 2
```

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Use consistent volume**: Keep Ableton output level steady
2. **Good quality synth**: Use a clear, harmonic-rich sound (piano/rhodes work well)
3. **Quiet environment**: Minimize background noise
4. **Longer duration for complex chords**: 7th/9th chords may need 2.5-3s
5. **Train periodically**: More frequent training (every 20-30 chords) gives better feedback

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

After training:
1. **Test the model** with `test_ml_chord_bass_response.py`
2. **Integrate into MusicHal_9000** for live chord detection
3. **Retrain periodically** to improve accuracy
4. **Expand chord vocabulary** to include more complex chords (9th, 11th, 13th, altered)

---

## 📊 Expected Results

With **84 basic chords** (7 roots × 2 qualities × 6 inversions):
- **Training time**: ~5-7 minutes
- **Total samples**: ~3,500-5,000
- **Expected accuracy**: 92-96%

With **360 chromatic chords** (12 roots × 5 qualities × 6 inversions):
- **Training time**: ~20-30 minutes  
- **Total samples**: ~15,000-20,000
